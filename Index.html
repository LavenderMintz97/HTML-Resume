        <P>A versatile professional, I wear the hat of an SEO Specialist during the day and transform
            into a Web Designer by night. With over 5 years of expertise in HR administration and sales
            coordination, I've fine-tuned my skills in management, organization, and marketing. In
            2023, I took a bold step, transitioning from HR recruiting to follow my passion for digital

        Firm, I am eager to transition into this new opportunity.</P>

    <P>Throughout my career, I have acquired a diverse set of skills through self-learning and hands-on
        work experience. I have honed my expertise in Graphic Design, basic SEO keywording using
